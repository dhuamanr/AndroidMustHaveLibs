 * AndroidAnnotations – Use blazing fast auto-generated classes and name-based code injection to save time with no performance penalty over hand-coded logic.
 * EventBus – Decouple components for more robust code, cross-component communication has never been simpler.
 * OkHttp – A clever replacement for HttpURLConnection, with support for asynchronous networking, request redirect route query, local cache query, and more.
